# PasswordEncryption

Encrypt content (e.g. a password db) behind a master password using [CryptoSwift](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift). 

For more details, see documentation on `PasswordEncryption.swift`.

## Notes

* Using a swift package rather than `.playground` for the swift package dependency
* Developed for practice and understanding, not to be used as is
* Extracted into a swift package from a legacy "Locker" iOS app. Some entities/functions may not be needed anymore.
